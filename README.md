## Introduction  
This project was created during a one-week deep dive where we were tasked to build Conway’s **Game of Life** from scratch.  

At the start, we had no idea where to begin. Through research, exploring repositories, YouTube tutorials, and studying the rules of the Game of Life, we gradually shaped our project into a working, interactive version.

## Project Timeline  

**Day 1**  
- Research phase: studied rules, repos, and YouTube tutorials.  

**Day 2**  
- Built an HTML table.  
- Implemented basic game logic to run the simulation automatically.  
- Later adjusted the logic to allow clearing/resetting the board.  

**Day 3**  
- Improved styling for a more attractive interface.  
- Collected feedback from other student groups.  
- Decided to implement alphabetic letters as mouse-input features.  

**Day 4**  
- Successfully integrated alphabetic letter inputs into the HTML table.  
- Added a **color picker** for cells.  

**Day 5**  
- Wrapped up the project.  
- Gave a **presentation to our school**, showcasing our Game of Life.

## Features  
- **Interactive Letter Input**  
  - Hover over a table cell and press a specific key to generate alphabetic letter patterns.  
- **Color Customization**  
  - Change the colors of all cells with a built-in color picker.  
- **Randomize Board**  
  - Fill the grid with random states.  
- **Clear Board**  
  - Reset the entire board with one action.  
- **Run Simulation**  
  - Play the Game of Life by its classic rules.

## Rules of the Game  
The Game of Life follows simple rules:  

1. Any live cell with **2 or 3 living neighbors** survives.  
2. Any dead cell with **exactly 3 living neighbors** becomes a live cell.  
3. All other live cells die in the next generation, and dead cells remain dead.

## How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project folder and copy the path of `index.html`.  

3. Open the file in your web browser to run the game.
